### School Loans Sentiments Project Proposal 

#### Question/need:
* What are the topics of most concern to those discussing affordable/universal healthcare?
* Answering this topic question can help to identify down the specific concerns of tax payers in their hesitation to supporting universal healthcare. After identifying these concerns, they can be targeted one by one to draft a better informed campaign for universal healthcare. 

#### Data Description:
* I plan to use twitter API data to pull in information on how lay people, as well as those with more influence in the social media realm discuss, argue, and feel regarding universal healthcare. 
* Ideally, the topic list would be overlayed with sentiment anlaysis, along with geographic delineation of some meaningful sort. 

* An individual sample or document of analysis will be a tweet.

#### Tools:
* I will be using NLP tools, including topic modeling, and sentiment anlaysis tools to develop this project. 

#### MVP Goal:
* A minimum viable product for this might be to narrow down a specific region to conduct a smaller sentiment analysis regarding the topic. If possible, it might even be nice to create a topic model within that smaller region as well.
